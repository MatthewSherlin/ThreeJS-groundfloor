# ThreeJS-groundfloor
This project was created using the JavaScript 3D library called Three.JS

Everything was created only using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This is my first project using Three.js, featuring a couple of rotating objects and text within a scene.

This project was created with inspiration from King Krule's "Cellular" off of "Man Alive!"
